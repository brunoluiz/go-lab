We will be working together in the `services/todo`.
You must implement Open Telemetry for tracing and metrics.

- Read the Golang docs: <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/go/>
- All the plumbing for Open Telemetry must be in a new package `internal/observability`
- I want to be able to see things in Jaeger, you must update the README.md with instructions.
