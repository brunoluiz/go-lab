# Commands

- `make run service=... cmd=...`: runs a binary with hot-reloading

# Wish list

- Format and linting should only take changed files
- Probably linter and tests need manual saving after ran since the cache action does not handle it nicely
- Consider how to deploy this... probably gitops via ArgoCD + overlays?
