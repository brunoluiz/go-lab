# Initial project decisions

- Using `godotenv` and `envconfig` instead of `urfave` or `viper` because this is not a CLI and the configurations will always be loaded through env configs.
- Using `gin` because of the amount of extras it includes when compared to `net/http`.
- Using `oapi-codegen` to play around with OpenAPI3 generated code
  - Problem 1: it needs YAML flattening to work well, otherwise the code is can be very verbose
  - Problem 2: no default values are set, which could be useful for errors, for example
